                        <p>This project involved the development of a React application. The main objectives include organizing the project structure correctly, implementing a MenuItem component to accurately render HTML for four specified properties, ensuring the application runs without errors or unexpected behavior, creating a Menu component that outputs expected HTML with dynamic data, and placing the MenuApp component correctly within the project structure with the expected child elements. The project demonstrated my understanding and proficiency in building React components, handling props, and structuring React applications according to provided specifications. No problems were encountered with this assignment.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this app is to create a React project that allows users to select different exercise options, each with either a "repetition" or "duration" type. These options are displayed as buttons, and when a user clicks on a button, the corresponding exercise component is rendered. The app requires the creation of two exercise components: RepetitionExercise and DurationExercise. RepetitionExercise allows users to increase a counter of repetitions and reset the counter, while DurationExercise enables users to start and stop a timer. Each exercise component displays the exercise name at the top and must maintain internal state for tracking repetitions or duration. The app aims to demonstrate proficiency in React component creation, state management, and conditional rendering. No problems were encountered with this assignment.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of this app is to create a mobile application using Expo and React Native. The app includes features such as a login screen, a registration screen, and a todo list screen, all managed through navigation using the Stack navigator from React Navigation. The initial setup involves creating an Expo project in the specified directory and installing necessary dependencies like React Navigation and Async Storage. The login screen skeleton is created with two input elements for username and password, along with buttons for login and registration. Functionality is added to the login screen to accept predefined test username and password, validate them against data stored in AsyncLocalStorage, and navigate to the todo screen upon successful login. The registration screen skeleton is created with input elements for various user details, including validation for each input field. Functionality is added to validate user input in real-time, display error messages for invalid input, and enable registration only when all fields are filled correctly.

                        <p>The purpose of this app is to create a simple quiz application using React Native, supporting React Native Navigation. The app consists of a Question component and a Summary component, both exported from App.js. The Question component receives a list of questions and the index of the current question as route parameters and allows the user to select their answer from three types: True/False, Multiple Choice, and Multiple Answer. After answering each question, the user can proceed to the next question by pressing a button. The app calculates the user's score and displays the correct answers with the Summary component. The Summary screen shows the total score, displays all questions, and indicates whether the user chose the correct or incorrect answer for each question. Each correct answer earns 1 point, regardless of the answer type. The app's functionality ensures that the user cannot go back to previous questions, providing a seamless quiz-taking experience.
